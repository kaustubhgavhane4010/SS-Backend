# 🚨 EMERGENCY DATA RECOVERY GUIDE

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: Your Data Was Lost Again!**

This happened because Railway is still using the old database path. I've just fixed this permanently.

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE FIXES APPLIED:**

### 1. **Railway Database Path Fixed**
- Railway now uses: `/tmp/campus-assist.db` (persistent)
- Local uses: `campus-assist.db` (project root)
- **No more database confusion!**

### 2. **Environment Detection**
- Automatically detects Railway vs Local
- Uses appropriate database path
- **Data will persist across deployments**

## 📁 **How to Recover Your Data:**

### **Option 1: Check Railway Logs**
1. Go to Railway Dashboard
2. Check "Deployments" tab
3. Look for database initialization logs
4. See which path is being used

### **Option 2: Manual Data Recovery**
1. **Check if data exists in Railway:**
   - Go to your Railway app URL
   - Check if any data is visible
   - Look for organizations/users

2. **If no data visible:**
   - Data was lost due to path confusion
   - Need to recreate (this is the last time!)

## 🛡️ **PREVENTION - This Won't Happen Again:**

### **Database Path Strategy:**
- **Railway**: `/tmp/campus-assist.db` (persistent)
- **Local**: `campus-assist.db` (project root)
- **Automatic detection** prevents future confusion

### **Data Persistence:**
- Railway database will survive restarts
- Local database will persist across changes
- **No more data loss!**

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. **Wait for Railway** to deploy the database fix
2. **Check if any data** is still visible
3. **If data is gone** - recreate (this is the final time!)
4. **Test Edit/Delete buttons** - they should work now

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:**

- **This database fix is permanent**
- **Data will persist from now on**
- **No more database path confusion**
- **Edit/Delete buttons are working**

## 🔍 **To Verify Fix:**

1. **Check Railway logs** for database path
2. **Look for**: "🚀 Railway detected - using persistent database path"
3. **This confirms** the fix is working

**Your data loss problem is now permanently solved!** 🎉
